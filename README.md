Using JS to make a ludo webpage

Honk. I am not dead... (I think? I already have too much necromancy done so I don't know anymore :skull:)

Here I am, again, talking to nobody until I finish doing this stuff (nobody cares what I do _\*sob sob\*_.) This time, I'll be making "Ludo", a somewhat well-known game (who am I kidding? it's a game which nobody forgets ;-;) using JS.

Well, as usual, I'll update this repository in somewhat irregular intervals (I got tests starting soon as well ;-;)

Until later, then

Honk
